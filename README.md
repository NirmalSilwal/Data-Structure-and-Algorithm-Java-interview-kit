## Java-practice

It will contain all logical problem and related concepts in **Java.** 

# ``` THIS REPO IS IN PROGRESS ... ``` 🚀 👨‍💻

Keep an 👁️ on it. I will be adding **Data Structures and Algorithm** implementaion along with problems related to the various DSA topics. 

*I AM WORKING EVERYDAY ON IT!*

## Directory Structure
## [Interview Prep](https://github.com/NirmalSilwal/Data-Structure-and-Algorithm-Java-interview-kit/tree/master/Interview%20Prep)
This directory has the solution to most of the famous coding interivew questions divided by topics from increasing order of difficulty and topics. **If you are time bounded, you can start practicing problems from this section directly or else from below section.**

## Data Structure and Algorithm Training
This directory covers from basic programming towards learning DSA. It was the part of my course taken from **CodingBlocks live Data Structure and Algo** batch.
