### Arrays and Strings

> String manipulation problems are in the same category as arrays, because internally, a string is represented as an array of characters. 
Array problems usually do not require knowledge of advanced data structures, so just basic data structures such as [Hash Tables](https://leetcode.com/articles/hash-table/) and basic techniques 
like [Two Pointers](https://leetcode.com/articles/two-pointer-technique/) should suffice.

> Google likes to test your ability to think at large scale by asking variation of problems represented in a [data stream model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_algorithm#Data_stream_model). 
For example, instead of giving you an integer array, you are given a stream of integers and all integers are too large to fit in memory. 
A great example of such problem, which can be represented in a data stream model, is the [Longest Substring with At Most K Distinct Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-with-at-most-k-distinct-characters/).

### Linked Lists

According to our user survey data, Linked List problems are not asked frequently at Google. Perhaps, most linked list problems are not that complex and it is harder to ask follow up and complexity analysis questions
Nonetheless, we strongly recommend you to still practice classic Linked List interview questions such as: Linked List Cycle, Intersection of Two Linked Lists, and Copy List with Random Pointers. These problems are really fun and they teach you how to think outside of the box.
Of course, Merge k Sorted Lists is one of our all-time favorite interview questions, and Google seems to love this question as well. Make sure you understand how to analyze the time complexity! This is a common follow up question for this problem.

### Trees and Graphs

Tree is just a special case of graph. To understand the difference between trees and graphs, you can work on Graph Valid Tree.
Graphs are generally breath-first search or depth-first search. The same applies to Trees, but trees never contain cycles.
Graphs are generally more complex than trees. Similarly, trees are generally more complex than linear data structures, such as arrays or linked lists.
Prepping your knowledge in Graphs is essential for Google interviews as you would most likely encounter a tree or a graph question. A great way to brush up your skills in this area is to implement a tree or graph by coding it from scratch in the Playground.
