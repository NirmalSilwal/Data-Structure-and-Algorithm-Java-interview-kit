This folder contains the my solution to sample problems given by [Maharishi International University](https://compro.miu.edu/), [Fairfield Iowa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairfield,_Iowa), 
for MS in CS admission.


**Note:** *Many solutions here can be optimised using inbuilt functions like Collections, using Hashing in many solutions. As these practice are based on **Arrays** I tried implementing without using any libraries as possible to build up the logic.*
